# Image-splicing-detection-Matlab

- Project is about segregating testing dataset into authentic and spliced images with SVM classifier.

# Getting Started

> These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local
> machine for development and testing purposes.

- Download all files to your MATLAB folder.
- [Image splicing dataset]
- move the images from imspliced folder to your MATLAB folder for the bunch of
images you want to test.
- Run Fitness_function_SVM.m and you are good to go with it.

This repository includes various feature extraction algorithms and other features as well that can be used to detect image splicing and two research papers.

> Must checkout my another repository [Image-splicing-detection-python], which uses Different set of features and is much better in terms of accuracy.
